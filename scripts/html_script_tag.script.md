Every Mistake in the Book
the lazy auto-didacts guide to html script tag.
Subtitle: 
  This is an overview of everything you need to in under 4 minutes that I learnt the hard way by taking the Long Way 'Round.
  I start by assuming you already know what html is, what it's for, and what a "tag" is, and what "attributes" are.
  if you can't do that yet, please go find a video that can show you how to create basic html page. Maybe a pic of you & your cat
  in your local firefox browser tab. I'm sure the Internet would like to see another one of those.

script tag
  type attribute
    "text/javascript"
  src attribute
  relative vs absolute locations
    hard-drive vs network location
  module vs nomodule
  charset for older browsers & codebases,
  if you see this in existing code, check with your PM on what the current & next-year statistics are
  on your web sites's 
  async vs defer vs "normal"
  multiple deffered scripts
